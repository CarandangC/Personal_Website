            <p>
                In my free time, I really enjoy going to the gym. I started going to the gym in the summer 
                of 2022 and have fallen in love with it ever since. I love being able to become a better 
                version of myself physically and mentally. The discipline it requires to show up for yourself 
                5-6 days a week to work out and keep track of what you're eating so that you can reap the benefits 
                has taught me to be more disciplined with myself. It has also taught me how to manage my time better 
                because going to the gym takes up a significant amount of time in my day, in my opinion. That's why I love it so much!
            </p>

                In addition to my passion for fitness and going to the gym, I also enjoy engaging in a variety of other activities during my free time. 
                One of my favorite hobbies is playing volleyball, which is a sport that I have been playing for several years now. 
                I love the competitive nature of the game, and I enjoy working together with my teammates to achieve our goals. 
                The feeling of setting the ball to a team mate and seeing them smash it over the net and scoring a point is incredibly satisfying, 
                and I find that playing volleyball helps me to stay active while also having fun.

                In addition to sports, I also enjoy watching anime. I find that anime offers a unique form of entertainment that can't be found in other 
                types of media. I love the vivid animation styles and engaging storylines that are often found in anime, and I find that watching it is a 
                great way to unwind and relax after a long day.
            </p>

                Finally, I also enjoy playing video games with my friends. This is a great way to spend time with my friends while also having fun and engaging 
                in a variety of different challenges. Whether we are playing competitive multiplayer games or cooperative games that require us to work together, 
                I always have a great time playing video games with my friends.
